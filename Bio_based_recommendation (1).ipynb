    "### Code Flow and Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Import Libraries**:\n",
    "   - Import necessary libraries for data manipulation, fuzzy matching, and NLP: `pandas`, `fuzzywuzzy`, `spacy`, `subprocess`, `nltk`, and `warnings`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Download NLTK Data**:\n",
    "   - Use `nltk.download('punkt')` to download necessary data for NLTK tokenization.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Load Excel File**:\n",
    "   - Load event data from the Excel file (`Events (1).xlsx`).\n",
    "   - Fill missing descriptions and subcategories with empty strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Create Combined Features**:\n",
    "   - Combine event names, descriptions, primary category, and subcategory into a single feature column (`combined_features`) for each event.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Load SpaCy Model**:\n",
    "   - A helper function `install_spacy_model()` installs the SpaCy model if it is not available. The `nlp` model is used for natural language processing tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Preprocess User Bios**:\n",
    "   - Function `preprocess_bios(bios)` converts user bios to lowercase and extracts nouns and adjectives using SpaCy, which are then stored as processed bios.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Event Recommendation Function**:\n",
    "   - The `recommend_events(user_bio, events_data, top_n=5)` function performs fuzzy matching between a user's bio and the combined features of events.\n",
    "   - It returns the top `n` recommended events based on similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Sample User Bios**:\n",
    "   - Two sample user bios are defined, representing interests like photography, music concerts, historical walks, and cultural events.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Preprocess and Recommend Events**:\n",
    "   - Each user bio is preprocessed, and recommendations are generated using fuzzy matching.\n",
    "   - Recommendations are stored in a DataFrame (`recommendations_df`) and displayed.\n",
    "\n"
